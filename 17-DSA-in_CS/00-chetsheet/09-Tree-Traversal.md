## Tree Traversal
Tree Traversal is a method of visiting all the nodes in a tree data structure. There are three main types of tree traversal, these include Preorder, Inorder, and Postorder. Preorder traversal visits the current node before its child nodes, Inorder traversal visits the left child, then the parent and right child, and Postorder traversal visits the children before their respective parents. There’s also a level order traversal which visits nodes level by level. Depth First Search (DFS) and Breadth First Search (BFS) are two popular algorithms used for tree traversal. DFS involves exhaustive searches of nodes by going forward if possible and if it is not possible then by going back. BFS starts traversal from the root node and visits nodes in a level by level manner.

## In-Order Traversal
In order traversal is a method for traversing binary trees. This method follows a specific order: Left Node, Root Node, then Right Node (L-N-R). Starting from the leftmost node of the tree, you first visit the left subtree, then the root node, and finally the right subtree. If the tree is a binary search tree, in order traversal will output the values of the nodes in the tree in ascending order. This traversal method is recursive in nature, as it requires each subtree to be visited in the exact same way.

## Pre-Order Traversal
Pre Order Traversal is a very specific kind of tree traversal in data structures. In this method of traversal, the process starts from the root node, then proceeds to the left subtree, and finally to the right subtree. To put it concisely, the order of traversal is Root, Left, and Right (often abbreviated as R-L-R). This makes it particularly useful in scenarios where it’s important to duplicate or clone a tree, or to get a prefix expression (Polish notation) of a binary expression tree.

## Post-Order Traversal
Post Order Traversal is a technique used in Binary Tree structure where each node is processed after its child nodes. As the name suggests, it first traverses the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node. The process is recursively repeated for each subtree until the entire tree has been traversed. This traversal method is often used for calculations that require that all child nodes be processed before the parent, such as evaluating a mathematical expression represented in a tree structure.
