## Tree Data Structures
A Tree data structure is a type of non-linear, hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It follows the parent-child relationship, with the top node being called the root. Each node in a tree can have child nodes and each of these child nodes has a single parent node. Nodes with same parents are known as siblings. Nodes without any children are referred to as leaves. Its structure allows the organization of data in a natural hierarchy. The simplification it provides in accessing, managing and manipulating data with complex relationships makes it a vital data structure in computer science. Implementations of the tree data structure are seen in databases, file systems, and HTML DOM.

## Binary Trees
A Binary Tree is a type of tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. This distinguishes it from trees in which nodes can have any number of children. A binary tree is further classified as a strictly binary tree if every non-leaf node in the tree has non-empty left and right child nodes. A binary tree is complete if all levels of the tree, except possibly the last, are fully filled, and all nodes are as left-justified as possible. Multiple algorithms and functions employ binary trees due to their suitable properties for mathematical operations and data organization.

## Binary Search Trees
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree data structure where each node carries a unique key (a value), and each key/node has up to two referenced sub-trees, the left and right child. The key feature of a BST is that every node on the right subtree must have a value greater than its parent node, while every node on the left subtree must have a value less than its parent node. This property must be true for all the nodes, not just the root. Due to this property, searching, insertion, and removal of a node in a BST perform quite fast, and the operations can be done in O(log n) time complexity, making it suitable for data-intensive operations.

## AVL Trees

An AVL tree is a type of binary search tree that is self-balancing, which means the heights of the two child subtrees of any node in the tree differ by at most one. If at any point the difference becomes greater than one, rebalancing is done to restore the property. The tree is named after its inventors, G.M. Adelson-Velsky and E.M. Landis, who introduced it in 1962. Each node in an AVL tree carries extra information (its Balance Factor) which could be either -1, 0, or +1. AVL trees balance themselves by rotating sub-trees in different manners(named as Left-Left rotation, Right-Right rotation, Left-Right rotation, and Right-Left rotation) whenever an insert operation causes the balance factor to go beyond this range.

## B-Trees
B-Tree is a self-balanced search tree data structure that maintains sorted data and allows for efficient insertion, deletion, and search operations. It is most commonly used in systems where read and write operations are performed on disk, such as databases and file systems. The main characteristic of a B-Tree is that all leaves are at the same level, and the internal nodes can store more than one key. Each node in a B-Tree contains a certain number of keys and pointers which navigate the tree. The keys act as separation values which divide its subtrees. For example, if a node contains the values [10,20,30] it has four children: the first contains values less than 10, the second contains values between 10 and 20, the third contains values between 20 and 30, and the fourth contains values greater than 30.
