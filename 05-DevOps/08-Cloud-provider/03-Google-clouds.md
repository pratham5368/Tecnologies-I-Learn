## Google Cloud
Google Cloud is Google’s cloud computing service offering, providing over 150 products/services to choose from. It consists of a set of physical assets, such as computers and hard disk drives, and virtual resources, such as virtual machines(VMs), that are contained in Google’s data centers. It runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Search, Gmail, Google Drive, and YouTube.
