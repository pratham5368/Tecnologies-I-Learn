//In addition to the comparison operators, which can be used on string values, the concatenation operator (+) concatenates two string values together, returning another string that is the union of the two operand strings.


console.log("my " + "string"); // console logs the string "my string".
//The shorthand assignment operator += can also be used to concatenate strings.


let mystring = "alpha";
mystring += "bet"; // evaluates to "alphabet" and assigns this value to mystring.
