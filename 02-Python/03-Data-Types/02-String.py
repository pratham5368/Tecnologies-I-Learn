expressed in several ways. They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...')
or double quotes ("...") with the same result.

    # pointing between characters, with the left edge of the first character
    # numbered 0. Then the right edge of the last character of a string of n
    # characters has index n, for example:
    #
    # +---+---+---+---+---+---+
